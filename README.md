## Main

Repo created during class to introduce us to the devise authorisation gem that can be used with rails.

For this you need to run:

```
gem install devise

```

And it creates the functionality to create new users, logging in and out from your account, and also performing precise tasks for someone who's logged in and not for someone who's not logged in (like adding, deleting or editing an article).

- There's still some bugs in the code which need to be fixed in order to make the app running properly.
